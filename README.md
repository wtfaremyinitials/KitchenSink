ideas with each other.
From this, Kitchen Sink was born.

KitchenSink (named from the phrase “it comes with everything and the kitchen sink”) is what we envision to be Sponge’s successor to BukkitDev. We want to create a place for plugin and/or mod(no proper terminology has been established yet) developers to post their plugins/mods and server admins to download and manage them.
	We see KitchenSink being a web tool, where plugins/mods can be hosted and downloaded, as well as an simpler plugin installer.

Plugins or mods will be installed via a cli command, such as ks install (plugin name) or (plugin id), or in game with /ks install with the same syntax.  (Both require a reload of server, so they probably would be added / loaded upon next reload.

Our current team:
Our current team has 3 members, which we hope to expand.

3 Partners:
wtfaremyinitials - Lead Developer - Chicago, USA.
BellLabs - Autonomous Installer Dev - New Jersey, USA.
masterpig - Developer & Documentation - England, UK.  


We hope more people in the future we will be able to expand our team and improve the quality of our work, globally.

We can often be found in IRC on Espernet in your #Sponge, and our #KitchenSink should you need to contact us for any reason. 

KitchenSink is currently being built on top of the Meteor.JS framework. It is a scalable, reactive, and database-everywhere framework that will allow us to get a prototype out quickly.  It will later allows us to develop a mobile version of Kitchen Sink if so desired.

Our goal is not to impede upon the Sponge Project and its wonderful goals. We want to work, as a community, to create a great platform.

We believe that all of this EULA and licensing “drama” that has been going on is a great chance for the community to start over and get things right, with minimal impact to productivity on anyones part. This work is born out of our love for a community that we want to see flourish and continue to expand.
